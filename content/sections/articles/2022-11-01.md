Yesterday I continued working on the next JS portfolio site from the template. My projects now show up nicely on the projects page, however I can’t seem to get the project images to load. I copied over the text for the project details pages, but I’m not quite sure how I want those pages laid out. I uploaded a profile page and have a link to email the photographer. There’s a section for blog posts, so I figured I’d duplicate these linkedIn posts there as well. I’ve copied over a few recent posts, but I'm not quite sure yet how to get them to display.

After working on my portfolio, I continued watching videos on the Angular framework as the company I interviewed with last week uses Angular. React and Angular are different, but I’m seeing the similarities between the two. I think I prefer the way Angular structures components, but the syntax will take some getting used to.
