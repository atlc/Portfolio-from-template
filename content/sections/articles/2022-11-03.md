I finished the task tracker app today. It was very helpful seeing everything I’ve done in react being done in angular. I’ve seen that some things are easier in React, and some are easier in Angular. Conditionally showing a component is so easy in Angular it’s like the feature was built-in. It’s possible in React, but it doesn’t feel like it's a built-in feature. In React, having parent components hold state, and pass it down to child components is pretty simple, but it takes a good amount of work to accomplish the same task in Angular.

I accepted a job at Streetmetrics! The position is for a junior front end developer; I signed the paperwork today and will be starting soon. I’m excited for this new opportunity to put my knowledge and skills to the test and work in a production level codebase. I’m grateful for my time and instructors at Covalence. I couldn’t have done it without you guys!
