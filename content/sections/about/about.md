Hello! I'm Eric Moran

I started my career in middle school math education to share my joy of math and learning with the next generation. I loved witnessing the moment when the gears started turning in a student's mind and the concept finally clicked for them. However, I personally didn't feel challenged in my career; I was missing something. The level of math I was teaching made me feel as if I wasn't growing my own understanding, and I wanted to stay mentally engaged with the material while also helping others. I remembered thinking about the Number Theory and Sets and Logic classes I took in college, and how rigorous, yet enjoyable they were; I wanted to find a career that would be as rewarding and resourceful as those classes were for me.

After attending and graduating from Covalence, a software development boot camp, I have once again found the challenging and rewarding environment that I've wanted to return to professionally, and I've already put it to use by helping my family and friends solve real-world problems. For one brief example, I have a friend who works at Gundam Planet that needed help with their manual release date tracking system. To test my newfound skills, I offered to build an app that would collect release date information for them and update it for them automatically - saving them hours of manual, tedious data entry work every day.

This project won't change the world, but it changed their world - and they absolutely loved it. Now they're using my software, and it has made their work life easier while it simultaneously helped me grow as a software developer. It gives me a tremendous amount of joy to know that the work I'm doing is improving someone else's life, and I have a greater sense of personal fulfillment because I am growing personally and professionally while still helping someone else. I'm still early in my software career, but I am extremely eager to continue developing this new skillset and passion as I help others along the way.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy baking, going outdoors, and gaming. My most delicious recipes are vegan banana bread and vegan pumpkin bread. My mother routinely sells out of these at her shop. Asheville NC has no lack of hiking trails or scenic views. I've heard you can hike one a day and still have new trails after a year. My favorite spots (so far) are Black Balsam Knob and Bearwallow Mountain. Waldeinsamkeit is an accurate description of the feeling you get when you reach the top and take in the view. I've recently been playing modded minecraft on a server with friends; it has been a great way to stay connected when we're all in different states. When I'm feeling a little more competitive, I'll hop on Master Chief Collection and do some games of big team on Halo 4.
